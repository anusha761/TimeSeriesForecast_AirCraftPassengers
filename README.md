# Aircraft Passengers Forecasting
> This project focuses on forecasting passenger traffic for a specific flight route by analyzing historical monthly data of passengers boarding the flights. The goal is to help the airline company better plan and allocate resources, such as aircrafts and flight attendants, during peak periods. Various time series analysis techniques have been applied, and different models have been fitted to generate accurate forecasts.

## General Information
- Project Overview: Forecasts passenger traffic for a specific flight route using historical monthly data to aid airline resource planning, such as aircraft and staff allocation during peak periods.

- Data Analysis: Applies time series techniques including decomposition (additive/multiplicative), stationarity tests, and ACF/PACF plotting to understand the dataâ€™s underlying patterns.

- Forecasting Method: Utilizes the SARIMA model (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) to generate accurate passenger traffic forecasts.

- Promotional Events Impact: Incorporates exogenous variables (promotional events) into the analysis, which affect passenger numbers, by using the SARIMAX model.

- Objective: Aims to provide actionable insights for the airline, improving efficiency and resource management during high-traffic periods.



## Conclusions
In conclusion, the time series analysis successfully provided accurate passenger traffic forecasts for the airline's specific route. The SARIMAX model, which included promotional events as an exogenous variable, significantly improved forecast accuracy, resulting in lower RMSE and MAPE values compared to the SARIMA model. These findings will help the airline optimize resource allocation during peak periods.
